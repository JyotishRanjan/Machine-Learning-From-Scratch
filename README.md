# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects implementing different algorithms using only NumPy and Pandas. Below is a brief description of each model and its application.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Classification
- **Description**: MLP is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. It consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
- **Application**: Used for classification tasks where the goal is to assign inputs to one of several classes.

### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Description**: SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.
- **Application**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and used for text classification, image recognition, etc.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Description**: CNN is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. It uses convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
- **Application**: Primarily used for image classification and recognition tasks.

### 4. Decision Trees
- **Description**: Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features.
- **Application**: Used for both classification and regression tasks.

### 5. Logistic Regression
- **Description**: Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (binary variable).
- **Application**: Commonly used for binary classification problems.

### 6. Linear Regression
- **Description**: Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Application**: Used for predicting the value of a target variable based on the values of the independent variables.

### 7. XGBoost
- **Description**: XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.
- **Application**: Widely used for regression, classification, and ranking tasks.

### 8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Description**: PCA is a statistical procedure that uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
- **Application**: Used for dimensionality reduction in data preprocessing.

### 9. Transformers for Text and Images
- **Description**: Transformers are deep learning models introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need". They are based on a mechanism called attention, and are highly effective in handling sequential data.
- **Application**: Used for various natural language processing tasks (e.g., text classification, machine translation) and image processing tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection).
